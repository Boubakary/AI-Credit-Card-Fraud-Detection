## Installation

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection.git
    cd AI-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Run the data preprocessing script to clean and preprocess the dataset:
     ```sh
     python scripts/data_preprocessing.py
     ```

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Use the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore and visualize the data.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Train the model using the model training script:
     ```sh
     python scripts/model_training.py
     ```

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the trained model and view the results in the `reports/` directory.
